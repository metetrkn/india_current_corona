# COVID-19 Analysis in India

    This repository contains a Python script that analyzes and visualizes the current COVID-19 situation in India. The script fetches data from the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and generates bar plots to display the distribution of COVID-19 cases across different states in India.

## Dataset

    The dataset is fetched from the Indian MoHFW website and contains the following features:

        state_name
        active
        positive
        cured
        death

## Project Overview

    Data fetching: The data is fetched from the Indian MoHFW website in JSON format and converted into a pandas DataFrame.

    Data preprocessing: Unnecessary rows and columns are removed from the dataset, and the data is cleaned.

    Data visualization: Bar plots are created to display the distribution of total, active, cured, and death cases across different states in India.

## Usage

    Clone this repository.
    Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed, along with the required libraries mentioned in the code (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

    Run the Python script to fetch the data and visualize the COVID-19 situation in India.
